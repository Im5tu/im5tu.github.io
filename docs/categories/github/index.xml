&lt;p>In this article, we&amp;rsquo;re going to take a look at how to create a private Helm repository with Github Pages. This guide requires you to have a Github Enterprise license as private Github Pages are only available to enterprise customers. I&amp;rsquo;m showing this approach for the scenarios where setting up something like &lt;a href="https://chartmuseum.com/">ChartMuseum&lt;/a> isn&amp;rsquo;t possible or unwanted. Although this guide uses helm as the example, you can extend this to host anything under a privately authenticated Github page.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
