It allows developers to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created, making it an excellent option for improving code flexibility and maintainability. This article will explore the concept behind the Factory Design pattern, its benefits, and how it can be implemented in C# code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2 MUST USE features for dotnet test debugging</title><link>https://im5tu.io/video/2-must-use-features-for-dotnet-test-debugging/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 May 2023 12:08:26 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://im5tu.io/video/2-must-use-features-for-dotnet-test-debugging/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this video, Stu demonstrates how to use the dotnet test feature to debug two types of test failures: test crashes and test hangs. Stu shows how to use the &amp;ldquo;blame-crash&amp;rdquo; parameter to generate sequence and memory dump files to help diagnose test crashes, and the &amp;ldquo;blame-hang&amp;rdquo; parameter to collect hang dumps when tests exceed the given timeout. He also shares how to set these parameters as csproj properties to achieve consistent debugging behavior. By the end of this video, viewers will have a valuable tool to help them save time when debugging test failures.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using The Decorator Design Pattern in .NET</title><link>https://im5tu.io/article/2023/05/using-the-decorator-design-pattern-in-.net/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 May 2023 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://im5tu.io/article/2023/05/using-the-decorator-design-pattern-in-.net/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Decorator design pattern is a widely-used technique for extending the functionality of an existing object or component. By wrapping an object in a series of decorators, you can add new behaviours, features, or properties without modifying the underlying code. This makes it a powerful and flexible way to customize and extend software systems. In .NET, the Decorator design pattern can be used in various ways to enhance and modify existing classes and components, which can help you write more maintainable, extensible, and flexible code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using The Singleton Design Pattern in .NET</title><link>https://im5tu.io/article/2023/05/using-the-singleton-design-pattern-in-.net/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 May 2023 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://im5tu.io/article/2023/05/using-the-singleton-design-pattern-in-.net/</guid><description>&lt;p>As a .NET developer, you understand the importance of writing efficient, scalable, and maintainable code. One design pattern that can help achieve these goals is the Singleton pattern. The Singleton pattern is a creational pattern that ensures only one instance of a class is created and provides global access to that instance throughout the application. In this blog post, we’ll look in-depth at the Singleton pattern, exploring its benefits, use cases, and implementation in C#. By the end of this post, you’ll have a solid understanding of how to leverage the Singleton pattern to optimize your .NET applications.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Observed No. 12 - Removing Pre-Commit Dependencies With Docker</title><link>https://im5tu.io/article/2023/05/observed-no.-12-removing-pre-commit-dependencies-with-docker/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2023 01:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://im5tu.io/article/2023/05/observed-no.-12-removing-pre-commit-dependencies-with-docker/</guid><description>&lt;p>Welcome to the 12th edition of Observed!

We will also go through some common questions that are often thrown in as curve balls during the process - including how to prevent them through efficient design.&lt;/p>

For example, we might have a combination of CPU usage, memory usage and web request latency. Some services like AWS CloudWatch Metrics only allow scaling based off a single value. Luckily, we can blend metrics together to create new ones, which we can then use in our scaling policies. A blended metric is made up of however one or more existing metrics that you choose, called aspects, and can be published as if it were any other metric, eg: publish to DataDog/Cloudwatch.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Publish Metrics to Cloudwatch in .NET Core</title><link>https://im5tu.io/article/2020/12/publish-metrics-to-cloudwatch-in-.net-core/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Dec 2020 16:21:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://im5tu.io/article/2020/12/publish-metrics-to-cloudwatch-in-.net-core/</guid><description>&lt;p>In a &lt;a href="https://im5tu.io/article/2020/01/diagnostics-in-.net-core-3-event-counters/">previous post&lt;/a> I took a look at how we can utilize .NET event counters to record metrics in our applications.

This is completely understandable as if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a product, you don&amp;rsquo;t have employment. This presents problems later when companies are beginning to scale rapidly and become popular. Not only does the company becomes a target for malicious actors, but security-related incidents can easily occur by leaving storage devices open accidentally. Once a malicious actor is in your system, you usually have pretty big problems unless you design your architectures with Zero Trust in mind.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Persisting Microsoft Orleans Grain State With DynamoDB</title><link>https://im5tu.io/video/persisting-microsoft-orleans-grain-state-with-dynamodb/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Nov 2020 01:18:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://im5tu.io/video/persisting-microsoft-orleans-grain-state-with-dynamodb/</guid><description>&lt;p>Following on from the previous video, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to setup grain persistence with DynamoDB local.
