Ever wondered how to get docker images to run nicely with XUnit tests? Then you&amp;rsquo;re in the right place. Let me show you how to setup Localstack with XUnit properly so that the only thing you need to worry about is having docker running. I&amp;rsquo;m using Localstack as the example but you can repeat a very similar process using the techniques shown here.</description></item><item><title>Extending the AWS SDK for .Net</title><link>https://im5tu.io/article/2022/01/extending-the-aws-sdk-for-.net/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2022 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://im5tu.io/article/2022/01/extending-the-aws-sdk-for-.net/</guid><description>&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

&lt;p>In this article we&amp;rsquo;re taking a look at how to extend the AWS SDK for .NET, which can be useful for various tasks like adding in some custom observability components into the request pipeline. This article is a companion resource for the video linked above in case you prefer a written version. I&amp;rsquo;m actively using the approach described here to implement distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry for all AWS calls at work.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using Certificates From AWS Private Certificate Authority in .NET</title><link>https://im5tu.io/article/2021/01/using-certificates-from-aws-private-certificate-authority-in-.net/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jan 2021 11:43:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://im5tu.io/article/2021/01/using-certificates-from-aws-private-certificate-authority-in-.net/</guid><description>&lt;p>As more and more companies get hacked, there is a strong resurgence in the community for the desire to have TLS for everything, everywhere. There are many valuable projects, tools and resources, such as &lt;a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">LetsEncrypt&lt;/a> available to help both individuals &amp;amp; companies secure their resources. One of those tools is AWS Private Certificate Authority.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blending Metrics Using EventCounters In C#</title><link>https://im5tu.io/article/2020/12/blending-metrics-using-eventcounters-in-c/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Dec 2020 12:53:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://im5tu.io/article/2020/12/blending-metrics-using-eventcounters-in-c/</guid><description>&lt;p>In a world where we use auto-scaling a lot, its often not just one metric that we will take into consideration when deciding whether or not to scale our applications. For example, we might have a combination of CPU usage, memory usage and web request latency. Some services like AWS CloudWatch Metrics only allow scaling based off a single value. Luckily, we can blend metrics together to create new ones, which we can then use in our scaling policies. A blended metric is made up of however one or more existing metrics that you choose, called aspects, and can be published as if it were any other metric, eg: publish to DataDog/Cloudwatch.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Publish Metrics to Cloudwatch in .NET Core</title><link>https://im5tu.io/article/2020/12/publish-metrics-to-cloudwatch-in-.net-core/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Dec 2020 16:21:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://im5tu.io/article/2020/12/publish-metrics-to-cloudwatch-in-.net-core/</guid><description>&lt;p>In a &lt;a href="https://im5tu.io/article/2020/01/diagnostics-in-.net-core-3-event-counters/">previous post&lt;/a> I took a look at how we can utilize .NET event counters to record metrics in our applications. However, I never covered the implementation of how I write the metrics to either CloudWatch or DataDog. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;m going to take a look at how to publish metrics to CloudWatch and one way of integrating it with the aforementioned blog series.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Building a Zero Trust Architecture In AWS</title><link>https://im5tu.io/article/2020/12/building-a-zero-trust-architecture-in-aws/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Dec 2020 15:38:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://im5tu.io/article/2020/12/building-a-zero-trust-architecture-in-aws/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the vast majority of companies that I&amp;rsquo;ve been in, software engineering &amp;amp; infrastructure best practises have often been left as something that needs to be updated later because building the product comes first. This is completely understandable as if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a product, you don&amp;rsquo;t have employment. This presents problems later when companies are beginning to scale rapidly and become popular. Not only does the company becomes a target for malicious actors, but security-related incidents can easily occur by leaving storage devices open accidentally. Once a malicious actor is in your system, you usually have pretty big problems unless you design your architectures with Zero Trust in mind.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
