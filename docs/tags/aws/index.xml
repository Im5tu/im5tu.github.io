If so, this video is for you. I take a sample of what I often receive as an architecture test and walk through how I would design the architecture on AWS explaining each design decision on the way - often with notes about the technology capabilities along the way. We will also go through some common questions that are often thrown in as curve balls during the process - including how to prevent them through efficient design.
Nothing in this video is scripted or prepared in anyway, just the scenario, the camera (which died) and my thoughts. Please do your own research on the techniques presented here before you implement them in your architectures to make sure you have a real understanding of how it all works.
If you like this video and want to see more like this, or have a scenario you would like me to cover, please let me know in the comments below and we can explore new scenarios together :)</description></item><item><title>Using Certificates From AWS Private Certificate Authority in .NET</title><link>https://im5tu.io/article/2021/01/using-certificates-from-aws-private-certificate-authority-in-.net/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jan 2021 11:43:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://im5tu.io/article/2021/01/using-certificates-from-aws-private-certificate-authority-in-.net/</guid><description>As more and more companies get hacked, there is a strong resurgence in the community for the desire to have TLS for everything, everywhere.

This is completely understandable as if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a product, you don&amp;rsquo;t have employment. This presents problems later when companies are beginning to scale rapidly and become popular. Not only does the company becomes a target for malicious actors, but security-related incidents can easily occur by leaving storage devices open accidentally. Once a malicious actor is in your system, you usually have pretty big problems unless you design your architectures with Zero Trust in mind.</description></item></channel></rss>
