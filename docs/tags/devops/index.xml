&lt;p>In this article, we&amp;rsquo;re going to take a look at how to create a private Helm repository with Github Pages. This guide requires you to have a Github Enterprise license as private Github Pages are only available to enterprise customers. I&amp;rsquo;m showing this approach for the scenarios where setting up something like &lt;a href="https://chartmuseum.com/">ChartMuseum&lt;/a> isn&amp;rsquo;t possible or unwanted. Although this guide uses helm as the example, you can extend this to host anything under a privately authenticated Github page.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My 3 Commonly Used Github Actions and their benefits</title><link>https://im5tu.io/video/my-3-commonly-used-github-actions-and-their-benefits/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 May 2021 09:59:07 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://im5tu.io/video/my-3-commonly-used-github-actions-and-their-benefits/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this Github Actions Tutorial, we take a look at three Github Action Workflows that I use on a regular basis for different projects that I work on, including:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Validation of commit messages (follow on from my previous Githooks video)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ensuring that a file is edited inside of a PR, and&lt;/li>

This is completely understandable as if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a product, you don&amp;rsquo;t have employment. This presents problems later when companies are beginning to scale rapidly and become popular. Not only does the company becomes a target for malicious actors, but security-related incidents can easily occur by leaving storage devices open accidentally. Once a malicious actor is in your system, you usually have pretty big problems unless you design your architectures with Zero Trust in mind.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Look Into CloudEvents</title><link>https://im5tu.io/article/2020/11/a-look-into-cloudevents/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Nov 2020 11:34:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://im5tu.io/article/2020/11/a-look-into-cloudevents/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over the past few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking into the internal architecture setup for &lt;a href="https://checkout.com">Checkout.com&lt;/a> and seeing how we can scale it for the next few years.
