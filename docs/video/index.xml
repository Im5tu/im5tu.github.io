Stu shows how to use the &amp;ldquo;blame-crash&amp;rdquo; parameter to generate sequence and memory dump files to help diagnose test crashes, and the &amp;ldquo;blame-hang&amp;rdquo; parameter to collect hang dumps when tests exceed the given timeout. He also shares how to set these parameters as csproj properties to achieve consistent debugging behavior. By the end of this video, viewers will have a valuable tool to help them save time when debugging test failures.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Saying Hello To The Newest .NET Community - WeAreDotnet!</title><link>https://im5tu.io/video/saying-hello-to-the-newest-net-community-wearedotnet/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Apr 2023 08:54:06 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://im5tu.io/video/saying-hello-to-the-newest-net-community-wearedotnet/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this first interview of a series, we&amp;rsquo;re meeting the founders of WeAreDotnet, a new .NET community.

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Validation of commit messages (follow on from my previous Githooks video)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ensuring that a file is edited inside of a PR, and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Updating all of my NuGet packages inside of 1 PR (rather than dependabots&amp;rsquo; 20)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>You can use the principals of the workflows shown and customise to your specific use cases to speed up your workflows.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Use Git Hooks To Automate Your Workflow</title><link>https://im5tu.io/video/use-git-hooks-to-automate-your-workflow/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Mar 2021 08:30:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://im5tu.io/video/use-git-hooks-to-automate-your-workflow/</guid><description>&lt;p>Git is a powerful version control system, but often we need to ensure certain patterns and practises are followed. Some of these workflows can be automated with Git Hooks. In this video, we will focus on client side git hooks and I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to write a quick commit message validation hook.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Snitch: The Smart Way to Clean Up Your .NET Dependencies</title><link>https://im5tu.io/video/snitch-the-smart-way-to-clean-up-your-net-dependencies/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Feb 2021 21:55:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://im5tu.io/video/snitch-the-smart-way-to-clean-up-your-net-dependencies/</guid><description>&lt;p>Transitive dependencies can be problematic when the same package is registered in multiple projects.

This is incredibly powerful for .NET library authors as they don&amp;rsquo;t have to wait for .NET 5 to take advantage of this amazing capability.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Get Started With OpenTelemetry Tracing and ASP.NET Core</title><link>https://im5tu.io/video/get-started-with-opentelemetry-tracing-and-asp-net-core/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Feb 2021 14:00:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://im5tu.io/video/get-started-with-opentelemetry-tracing-and-asp-net-core/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this OpenTelemetry Tutorial, take a look at how to quickly get up and running with OpenTelemetry in an ASP.NET Core application. You&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to setup the automatic instrumentation for both inbound and outbound web requests and how to configure the Jaeger Exporter (&lt;a href="https://jaegertracing.io">https://jaegertracing.io&lt;/a>) - running it all in a local environment.&lt;/p>

If so, this video is for you. I take a sample of what I often receive as an architecture test and walk through how I would design the architecture on AWS explaining each design decision on the way - often with notes about the technology capabilities along the way. We will also go through some common questions that are often thrown in as curve balls during the process - including how to prevent them through efficient design.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nothing in this video is scripted or prepared in anyway, just the scenario, the camera (which died) and my thoughts. Please do your own research on the techniques presented here before you implement them in your architectures to make sure you have a real understanding of how it all works.&lt;/p>
