Stu shows how to use the &amp;ldquo;blame-crash&amp;rdquo; parameter to generate sequence and memory dump files to help diagnose test crashes, and the &amp;ldquo;blame-hang&amp;rdquo; parameter to collect hang dumps when tests exceed the given timeout. He also shares how to set these parameters as csproj properties to achieve consistent debugging behavior. By the end of this video, viewers will have a valuable tool to help them save time when debugging test failures.</description></item><item><title>Saying Hello To The Newest .NET Community - WeAreDotnet!</title><link>https://im5tu.io/video/saying-hello-to-the-newest-net-community-wearedotnet/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Apr 2023 08:54:06 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://im5tu.io/video/saying-hello-to-the-newest-net-community-wearedotnet/</guid><description>In this first interview of a series, we&amp;rsquo;re meeting the founders of WeAreDotnet, a new .NET community.
