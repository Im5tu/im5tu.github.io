title: Anti-Corruption Layer
---

The Anti-Corruption Layer is a design pattern that prevents incompatible systems from affecting each other. It acts as a translator, ensuring that the receiving system converts data and requests for services into an understandable and usable format. This layer safeguards the integrity of both systems, enabling smooth interaction without compromising their respective designs.

## How to implement an anti-corruption layer

Implementing this pattern is a strategic process that requires careful planning and execution. This process is not just about creating a barrier between systems; it ensures seamless communication, access and data integrity between disparate systems. To achieve this, several critical steps need to be meticulously followed:

1. **Identifying the Boundaries**: The first step is to define where the new system ends and the legacy system begins. This demarcation is essential to understanding the scope and application of the ACL, ensuring that it functions effectively where it's most needed.
2. **Defining the Translation Logic:** Develop the logic to translate requests and data between the systems. This includes mapping data models, translating commands, and converting responses.
3. **Creating Interface Adapters**: Creating the ACL involves developing components facilitating communication between different systems. These components, often functioning as adapters, are positioned at the boundaries of each system. They are responsible for translating data, ensuring the information is accurately converted and relayed. A critical decision in this process is determining whether the ACL should be integrated within an existing service or established as a separate service. Opting for a separate service can enhance isolation and scalability, although it may add to the system's complexity and introduce some latency. Conversely, incorporating the ACL directly into an existing service can streamline the architecture and potentially boost performance, but this approach may result in tighter coupling between systems and reduce the flexibility for reuse in different contexts.
4. **Testing for Compatibility**: Rigorously test the ACL, ideally via automation, to ensure that it accurately translates data and requests without causing data corruption or loss of information. This step is crucial to validate the effectiveness of the ACL and its components, whether implemented as a separate service or within an existing one.
5. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Continuously monitor the ACL for performance issues and adapt it as the external systems or the domain model evolves.

## When to use an anti-corruption layer pattern

This pattern is a powerful solution, particularly where system integrity and data consistency are paramount. This pattern is not just a technical implementation; it's a strategic approach to safeguarding your system's design and functionality amidst diverse and potentially conflicting external influences. Here are some key scenarios where implementing an ACL becomes particularly beneficial:

1. **Integrating with legacy systems**: When a new system needs to interact with a legacy system, an ACL can prevent the old system's outdated models and practices from affecting the new system.
2. **Working with an external system**: In cases where your system needs to communicate with an external system, an ACL can ensure that incompatible interfaces or data models do not corrupt your system's domain model.
3. **During system refactoring**: When refactoring a large system, an ACL can serve as a temporary buffer, allowing you to gradually transition functionality without disrupting existing operations.

## When not to use an anti-corruption layer pattern

Whilst this pattern can be valuable in many architectural scenarios, there are certain situations where its implementation may not be ideal or even counterproductive. Understanding these patterns and contexts is crucial for architects and developers to make informed decisions that align with their system's needs and goals. Here are some key situations where the use of an ACL might not be the best approach:

1. **Simple Integrations**: If the systems involved have compatible interfaces and domain models, implementing an ACL might be unnecessary and could introduce unwanted complexity.
2. **Performance-Critical Applications**: In applications where performance is a key concern, the additional processing overhead of an ACL might be detrimental.
3. **Highly Coupled Systems**: In systems where components are tightly coupled, implementing an ACL can be challenging and may require significant refactoring.

## Example use case for the anti-corruption layer pattern

Consider a financial services company that has recently upgraded its customer management system but still relies on a legacy accounting system. The new system uses a modern, RESTful API, while the legacy system uses an outdated SOAP-based interface with a completely different data model. An ACL can be implemented to translate the data and requests between these two systems, ensuring seamless operation of other systems without compromising the integrity of either system.

## Challenges

One of the main challenges in developing an ACL is having a translation layer that accurately maps different data models, which can be complex, especially when dealing with legacy systems with outdated or poorly documented APIs. Keeping the ACL updated with changes in the system's data model or business logic can be challenging, requiring ongoing maintenance and monitoring.

An additional translation layer can also introduce latency, which might be significant in high-performance systems.

## Best Practices

One mistake I've often seen is not clearly defining the boundaries of each system and what data or requests need to be translated, as this helps in isolating the systems and reducing the complexity of the ACL. Start with a basic implementation and gradually expand the ACL's capabilities. This approach allows for testing and refinement in real-world scenarios.

Where possible, implement automated testing to ensure system changes do not break the ACL's functionality. Continuous integration can help in quickly identifying and fixing issues. Maintain comprehensive documentation of the ACL's logic and mappings. This is crucial for future maintenance and for new team members to understand the system.

## The Role of Anti-Corruption Layers in Domain-Driven Design

In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), the Anti-Corruption Layer plays a vital role in supporting and maintaining the integrity of the domain model when integrating with external systems or legacy code.

The ACL ensures that the domain model remains pure and unaffected by external models or systems, which might have different semantics or structures. It helps implement the concept of Bounded Contexts in DDD, allowing different parts of the system to evolve independently without affecting each other, ensuring clear communication between different domains or teams, each with their own ubiquitous language.
