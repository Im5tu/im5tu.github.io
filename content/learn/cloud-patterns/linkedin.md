🌟 Example Use Case:
In a cloud-based application, each microservice is deployed with a sidecar that handles logging and external communications. This setup simplifies the microservices by offloading common functionalities to the sidecar.

LinkedIn Post: Static Content Hosting

🔍 What the Pattern Is:
Static Content Hosting is a pattern where static resources like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and videos are hosted on highly optimized and scalable infrastructure. This approach decouples static content from dynamic content, improving performance and scalability.

🚀 When to Use the Pattern:
Use Static Content Hosting for websites and applications with a significant amount of unchanging content. It's ideal for improving load times, reducing server load, and enhancing user experience, especially in content-heavy applications.

🛑 When Not to Use the Pattern:
Avoid this pattern if your application consists mainly of dynamic content, where the benefits of separate hosting for static content are minimal. It's also less suitable for small-scale applications where the setup and maintenance of separate hosting might not be justified.

🌟 Example Use Case:
A media website uses Static Content Hosting to serve images and videos. This approach allows for faster content delivery and reduces the load on the main servers, which are focused on handling dynamic content and user interactions.

LinkedIn Post: Strangler Fig

🔍 What the Pattern Is:
The Strangler Fig pattern is an approach to gradually migrate a legacy system to a new system. Instead of a big-bang replacement, functionality is incrementally transferred to the new system, like a strangler fig vine gradually enveloping and replacing a tree.

🚀 When to Use the Pattern:
Implement the Strangler Fig pattern in scenarios where a complete system overhaul is risky or impractical. It's ideal for large, legacy systems needing modernization, allowing for a gradual transition with minimal disruption.

🛑 When Not to Use the Pattern:
Avoid this pattern for small-scale applications where a complete rewrite might be more efficient. It's also less suitable in scenarios where the legacy and new systems cannot coexist due to technical or business constraints.

🌟 Example Use Case:
A company with an outdated e-commerce platform adopts the Strangler Fig pattern. They gradually replace parts of the system, starting with the inventory management module, while the rest of the system continues to operate as usual.

LinkedIn Post: Throttling

🔍 What the Pattern Is:
Throttling is a control mechanism used to regulate the rate of requests sent or received by a network, application, or service. This pattern helps in managing resource utilization, maintaining service availability, and preventing system overloads.

🚀 When to Use the Pattern:
Use Throttling in systems where it's crucial to control the flow of requests to prevent overloading resources. It's particularly effective in APIs, web services, and applications that face variable and potentially high demand.

🛑 When Not to Use the Pattern:
Avoid Throttling in environments where request rate variability is low or where limiting the request rate could significantly impact performance or user experience. It's also less suitable in closed systems with predictable and manageable workloads.

🌟 Example Use Case:
An API gateway implements Throttling to limit the number of requests a user can make within a certain time frame. This prevents any single user from overloading the system, ensuring fair resource allocation and consistent service availability.

LinkedIn Post: Valet Key

🔍 What the Pattern Is:
The Valet Key pattern is a cloud design pattern used to provide clients with a temporary direct access to a specific resource or service. Similar to a valet giving you a key to access your car, this pattern allows direct access without going through the main application logic.

🚀 When to Use the Pattern:
Implement the Valet Key pattern in scenarios where direct and efficient access to resources like files or data blobs is needed. It's ideal for reducing load on the main application, improving performance, and providing a better user experience.

🛑 When Not to Use the Pattern:
Avoid this pattern if security and access control are major concerns, as it grants direct access to resources. It's also less suitable in scenarios where resource access needs to go through complex business logic or validation.
