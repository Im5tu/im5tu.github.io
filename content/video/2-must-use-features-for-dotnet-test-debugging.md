In this video, Stu demonstrates how to use the dotnet test feature to debug two types of test failures: test crashes and test hangs. Stu shows how to use the "blame-crash" parameter to generate sequence and memory dump files to help diagnose test crashes, and the "blame-hang" parameter to collect hang dumps when tests exceed the given timeout. He also shares how to set these parameters as csproj properties to achieve consistent debugging behavior. By the end of this video, viewers will have a valuable tool to help them save time when debugging test failures.
