In this Github Actions Tutorial, we take a look at three Github Action Workflows that I use on a regular basis for different projects that I work on, including:

- Validation of commit messages (follow on from my previous Githooks video)
- Ensuring that a file is edited inside of a PR, and
- Updating all of my NuGet packages inside of 1 PR (rather than dependabots' 20)

You can use the principals of the workflows shown and customise to your specific use cases to speed up your workflows.
