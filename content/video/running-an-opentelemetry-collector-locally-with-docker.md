Recently weâ€™ve looked into adding logs, metrics & traces using console exporters. In reality, we want to send this telemetry to one or more places. Collectors allow your service to offload data quickly, standardise access to protected exporter endpoints and can take care of additional handling like retries and batching.

In this video, you will learn:

- The difference between the standard collector and the contributors collector
- How to run an OpenTelemetry Collector using docker compose
- How to configure an OpenTelemetry Collector
