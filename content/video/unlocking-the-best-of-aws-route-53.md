In this video, I will show you the power of wildcards, health checks, and, my favourite, a Netflix-style multi-region DNS setup for scenarios on AWS Route 53. You'll learn about the many capabilities of this service and how to use it to your advantage. Each section is accompanied by Terraform code. This video was originally was posted under DevOpsWithStu, but since then I have merged the channels together.
