In this OpenTelemetry Tutorial, take a look at how to quickly get up and running with OpenTelemetry in an ASP.NET Core application. You'll learn how to setup the automatic instrumentation for both inbound and outbound web requests and how to configure the Jaeger Exporter (https://jaegertracing.io) - running it all in a local environment.
