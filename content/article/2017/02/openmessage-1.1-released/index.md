Just a quick update to say that the Azure provider for [OpenMessage](https://github.com/Im5tu/OpenMessage) has been released. This update fixes an issue with scheduling messages on topics.

<!--more-->

As part of this update, the entire solution has been converted to the new (old) csproj system as part of Visual Studio 2017. Over the next few days i'll be posting the roadmap for the project and where I plan to take it next. Feedback and ideas are welcome.

If you experience any problems, let me know.
