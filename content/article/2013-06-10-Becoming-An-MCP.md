As the title suggests, today I passed the 70-483 Programming in C# exam to offically become a Microsoft Certifed Professional.

This is one of the things that has been in my sights for a very long time now, so I am extremly happy to have passed. I throughly recommend doing it for yourself if you haven't done so already. I know exams aren't everyones cup of tea, but even if you decide not to take the exam, I believe that the knownledge you gain during the study phase will prove invaluable to your day to day work.

Since I already had 5 years programming experience with the .Net environment, the exam was mainly a tick in the box. That said, I would throughly recommend you read the [CLR via C# Forth Edition](http://www.amazon.co.uk/CLR-via-Developer-Reference-ebook/dp/B00AA36R4U/ref=tmm_kin_title_0/277-8084778-0056569). The book gives a fantasic insight into the inner workings of the CLR and why some features are not supported by C#.

I wish you all the best of luck if you decide to take this exam.
