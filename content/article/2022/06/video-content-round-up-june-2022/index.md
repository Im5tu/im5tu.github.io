Over the past month I've rebooted my [YouTube Channel](https://bit.ly/im5tu-youtube) as I've had some additional time to sit down and think about how I want things to go moving forward. Here are some of the key updates from the channel. Be sure to take a look and let me know your thoughts.

## Style Updates

As with any reboot, you take a look at what's there initially and see what can be improved. A number of key things I noticed were:

- It took a long time to get to the actual content in some videos - in the newer videos, I try to get to the point quicker so you get your questions answered
- Look/Feel update - Some of the thumbnails left a little bit to be desired, so with help from the [VidIQ](https://www.youtube.com/c/Vidiq) community, I had a go at making some more appealing thumbnails to go with the newer content. Let me know what you think in the comments or on [Twitter](https://bit.ly/im5tu-tw)
- Shorts - Some of the videos that I want to make don't really fit into a longer form content, so over the next few
- Targetted [playlists](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeWithStu/playlists) - As I develop more content, I want it to be a bit easier for you to discover related content. For example, as I upload more [OpenTelemetry Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0G9M6AuTdo&list=PLdvI3YlPDGgdFG2mlXOy403V0J3MhRHeE) over the coming weeks it'll be handy to watch them all so you can see the full power of OpenTelemetry.
