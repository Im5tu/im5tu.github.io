Hello World. Safe to say it's been a little while since I have blogged or even had a website come to think of it. Alas, I am back with some fresh ideas and recharged to help you dear reader.

Finally I've been able to match up my Github/Twitter handles with my website to make things alot easier to find. I've also began to build this site on a static site generator called hugo, hosted by Github pages and delivered through Cloudflare. My first port of call is to show you how i've done it should you wish to re-create my steps for yourself. Naturally, steps may vary as time progresses and things change - so feel free to fix any instructions on my [Github repository](https://github.com/Im5tu/im5tu-hugo).
